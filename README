clocklet

Dependencies:
-------------
Python 2.6, at least
adesklets

General:
--------
clocklet is a configurable desktop widget for displaying the time, 
however you want.

I wrote it after seeing a few date/time widgets in different widget programs
that weren't quite up to what I expected. Hopefully it satisfies your needs.

Installation:
-------------

Simply run the program with python, i.e. "python clocklet.py", it will ask 
if you want to register or test the torrent. I recommend testing it first 
to make sure it does what you want. If it does, run it again and choose register.

Configuration:
--------------

Configuration is done via the config.txt file. Example configs are included in the 
example-configs folder. It's quite straight-forward in my opinion, but I'll do a 
rundown on the options.

alpha    - level of transparency, 0-255.
caps     - capitalise all text or not.
color    - the color you want your text to be.
displays - displays is a tuple of maps. The basic map layout is this:
   font     - the font to use for this specific display. Layout should be NAME/SIZE.
   format   - The text to display. E.g. "%M" will display minutes.
   x_pos    - X co-ord to display the above format text at. Can be either a string 
              or a hard coded number.
   y_pos    - same deal as x_pos, but for Y co-ord.

height   - height of the widget.
width    - width of the widget.
